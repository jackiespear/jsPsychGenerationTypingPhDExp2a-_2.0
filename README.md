# jsPsychGenerationTypingPhDExp2a
Experiment 2a of my PhD Thesis. Generation by typing using words from Johns and Swanson (1988).

This experiment is a standard yes/no recognition memory test.

During the study phase, participants will be presented with word pairs. One half of these word pairs will be completed intact word pairs, and one half will be a completion paired with a stem (e.g HOT - COLD or HOT - C_ _ _?). Subjects will be instructed to generate an incomplete word stem by typing, or to simply read the intact word pair.

Both pure and mixed lists will be used.

Each participant will be presented with a total of 40 word pairs during the study phase.

Participants will then be tested for their recognition of the second word in each pair, one at a time, along with an equal amount of new, unstudied lures (80 words in total).
